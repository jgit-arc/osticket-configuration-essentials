# osTicket - Configuration Essentials

This is a continuation of the *osTicket: Getting Started* repo found [here](https://github.com/jgit-arc/osticket-getting-started). The goal of this walkthrough is to provide hands-on experience with osTicket by configuring roles, departments, teams, agents, SLAs, etc., to simulate a real, working environment.

I am using a Windows virtual machine hosted on Microsoft Azure. The VM is named `osticket-vm` and runs Windows 10 Pro (2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM). This guide does not delve into Azure-specifics or virtual machine setup. However, these steps will work on any version of Windows 10, whether running on a VM or not.

## Accessing osTicket

<p>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/XtM1X7K/osticket-login.png"/>
</p>

osTicket has two URLs you will use frequently:
- localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php
- localhost/osTicket

The admin/analyst login is where all of the setup and configuration happens. The end-user login is how anyone working with the software would access it normally. In this and the following walkthrough, I will cover the functionality of both.

## 2. Agent Panel vs Admin Panel

<p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/sqH5wBZ/admin-bottom.png" alt="Admin Panel"/>
</p>

If you have not done so already, go to the admin login and sign in as an admin using the credentials you created from the previous walkthrough. While logged in as an admin, you have access to two panels: **Agent Panel** and **Admin Panel**. 

- The **Admin Panel** allows you to configure settings.
- The **Agent Panel** more closely represents the end-user experience, allowing you to create, read, and edit tickets.

To determine which panel you are on, look at the toggle in the top-right corner:
- If it shows "Agent Panel," you are currently on the Admin Panel (and vice versa).

## 3. Configure Roles

<p>

</p>

From the **Admin Panel**, click **Agents**, then click **Roles**. By default, osTicket includes varying levels of role access. These can be modified, or you can create your own.

For example, the "Expanded Access" role allows users to do everything except delete a ticket or mark it as answered. Roles can be assigned to departments and individuals.

1. From the **Agents** tab, click **Add New Role**.
2. Name the role (e.g., `Main Admin`).
3. Click the **Permissions** tab.
4. Select permissions for the role. For this walkthrough, select all permissions under the **Tickets**, **Tasks**, and **Knowledgebase** tabs.
5. Click **Add Role**.

## 4. Configure Departments

<p>

## 5. Configure Teams

<p>

SLAs prioritize tasks based on urgency.
